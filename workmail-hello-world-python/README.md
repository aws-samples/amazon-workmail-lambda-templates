# Amazon WorkMail Hello World

This is a Hello World function that shows Amazon WorkMail integration 
with AWS Lambda. When you deploy it to your account, the system creates a 
Lambda function with all the necessary resources and permissions to access and modify incoming events from WorkMail.

Add your own business logic to the Lambda function based on your use-case.
For more information see [AWS WorkMail Lambda documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/lambda.html)

## Development

### Using the AWS Lambda Console
1. Deploy this application via [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:489970191081:applications~workmail-hello-world-python)
2. Open the [WorkMail Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/) and create a **RunLambda** [Email Flow Rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/create-email-rules.html) that uses this Lambda function.

You now have a working Lambda function that will be triggered by WorkMail based on the rule you created. To add business logic to your Lambda function, open the [AWS Lambda Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions) to edit and test your Lambda function with the built-in code editor.

For more advanced use cases, such as changing your CloudFormation template to create additional AWS resources that will support this application, follow the instructions below.

### Developing locally
Clone this repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-workmail-lambda-templates).

We recommend creating and activating a virtual environment, for more information see [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

If you are not familiar with CloudFormation templates, see [Learn Template Basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/gettingstarted.templatebasics.html).

1. Create additional resources for your application by changing [template.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-workmail-lambda-templates/blob/master/workmail-hello-world-python/template.yaml). See this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html) for more details.
2. Modify your Lambda function by changing [app.py](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-workmail-lambda-templates/blob/master/workmail-hello-world-python/workmail-hello-world/app.py).
3. Test your Lambda function locally:
    1. [Set up the SAM CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).
    2. Configure environment variables at `tst/env_vars.json`.
    3. Configure test event at `tst/event.json`.
    4. Invoke your Lambda function locally using:
    
        `$ sam local invoke WorkMailHelloWorldFunction -e tst/event.json --env-vars tst/env_vars.json`

Once you have validated that your Lambda function behaves as expected, you are ready to deploy this Lambda function.

### Deployment
If you develop using the AWS Lambda Console, then this section can be skipped.

Please create an S3 bucket if you do not have one yet, see [How do I create an S3 Bucket?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html).
and check how to create a [Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/serverlessrepo-how-to-publish.html#publishing-application-through-cli).
We refer to this bucket as `<Bucket-Name-For-Deployment>`.

This step bundles all your code and configuration to the given S3 bucket. 

```bash
$ sam package \
 --template-file template.yaml \
 --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
 --s3-bucket <Bucket-Name-For-Deployment>
```

This step updates your Cloud Formation stack to reflect the changes you made, which will in turn update changes made in the Lambda function.
```bash
$ sam deploy \
 --template-file packaged.yaml \
 --stack-name workmail-hello-world \
 --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
Your Lambda function is now deployed. You can now configure WorkMail to trigger this function.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Where are the logs?
You can find the logs in CloudWatch. For more information see [Accessing Amazon CloudWatch logs for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html).

### How do I obtain a real message id for my `event.json` file?
1. Make sure your Lambda function prints out the message id from an event.
2. Deploy your Lambda function and add the Lambda rule to your WorkMail organization.
3. Send a test email from your WorkMail account.
4. Check your CloudWatch logs for a printed message id.

Note that you can access messages in transit for a maximum of one day.
